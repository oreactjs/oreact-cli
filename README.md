# Oreact CLI 
Oreact-CLI helps you get started developing and deploying a full stack Oreact application in just a few seconds.

Oreact-CLI is a tool that abstracts all complex configuration needed for SSR into a single dependency--giving you the awesome developer experience of create-react-app. Oreact CLI takes the pain out of starting a new project, getting you up and running instantly with a minimal and understandable project structure.

It's powered by the same Open Source tools you know and love, just without the need to configure anything - Webpack, Babel, Tailwind, Razzle, etc. Everything from hot-reloading to critical CSS inlining is set up optimally for you.

yarn global add oreact-cli
